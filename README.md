# seagrassdb

This repository contains the supplementary material for the seagrassDB while i was working at UTS, you can find the unigenes, annotations, coding seqeunces and proteins. All the comparative analysis is also present and all the analyzed files. The link to the paper is [SeagrassDB](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29426939/). Additionally, the webserver is not accessible and hence you can use this git account or fork this for your analysis.If you need on how to do the comparative analysis then drop me an email and I will put all the comparative analysis for this paper.
